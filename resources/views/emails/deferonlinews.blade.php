# Application Deferred (Online Workshops)


Hello {{$student->fname." ".$student->lname}},
<br />

Your online internship application is being processed. Due to high demand in your internship pathway, and based on the number of employers participating this semester, we couldn’t assign your first semester of choice.<br/><br/>
In the event a spot becomes available in your semester of choice, students who have completed the workshop training will receive priority placement. Click the link below to register for the workshops to prepare you for this opportunity. 
<br/>

<strong>Requirement for priority placement:</strong>
<br />
<ol type="1">
<li>Check your school email for an invite to a Canvas course to each workshop.  By completing the workshops as soon as possible, you will be able to improve your position on the priority list.</li>
<li>Please note a LinkedIn Agreement must be completed to participate in the internship program.  Be sure to complete that assignment in the Canvas course.</li>
</ol>

If your situation has changed, and you are no longer able to pursue the internship, let us know as soon as possible.
<br /><br />You will be receiving more communication as we get closer. Work hard, keep your G.P.A. high, and continue to be engaged in your classes. If you have any questions please feel free to contact either of us listed below.
<br />Thank you for applying to the CTE Washk12 Internship Program!
