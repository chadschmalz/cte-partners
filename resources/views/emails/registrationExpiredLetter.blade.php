# Priority Registration Expired

Hello {{$student->fname." ".$student->lname}},

We haven't received a confirmation of your registration for the worksop training courses within the 7 days time frame.<br /><br />

You may still complete the training courses, but will not receive priority placement.<br />
In the event a spot becomes available, students that have completed the workshop training will get priority placement. <br /><br />

<strong>Registration for training within 7 days was required for priority placement</strong>
