# Priority Registration Expired

Hello {{$student->fname." ".$student->lname}},

We haven't received  your preference for the workshop training courses within the 7 day time frame.<br /><br />

Registration for training within 7 days was required for <strong>priority</strong> placement.

You may still complete the training courses, but will not receive priority placement.<br /><br />
However, in the event a spot becomes available, students who have completed the workshop training will earn priority placement. <br />
