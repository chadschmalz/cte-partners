# Application Deferral Letter

Hello {{$student->fname." ".$student->lname}},

Your online internship application is being processed. Due to one of the following reasons, we couldn’t assign your first semester of choice.<br /><br />
Possible Reasons:
<ol type="1">
<li>We don’t have any more room in your semester of choice with our employers for the internship you chose. -or-</li>
<li>You may need to take a prerequisite CTE pathway course to qualify for this capstone internship course.</li>
</ol>
<br />

In the event a spot becomes available, in your semester of choice, students that have completed the workshops will get priority placement. <br /><br />
At this time you have two options to continue:<br />
<ul>
<li>Option 1: Get on the priority enrollment list by completing enrollment tasks.</li>
<li>Option 2: Defer enrollment and reserve a seat in the following semester.</li>
</ul>
